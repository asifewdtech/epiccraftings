        </h3>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify">Custom Neon creates beautiful, handmade neon signs, LED neon light
            installations, lamps & wall art. Let us light up your business logo, name, favorite quote or image &
            turn it into something amazing.</p>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify">
            The majority of our work -including the signs shown on this page- is done in LED flex, which has become
            increasingly popular in recent years as a fantastic alternative to the
            old style neons made of glass tubes. There are some compelling reasons to work with this new technology,
            but if you are after the classic look and would like to get sign or
            piece of art made from glass neon, just let us know.
        </p>
        <h3 class="cl-7E13AE py-3">Some great reasons to choose a LED neon sign from us are:
        </h3>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify mb-2">- <b class="cl-7E13AE">Durable</b> We offer the latest neon flex
            technology which is stronger
            and
            lighter than glass neon.
        </p>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify mb-2">- <b class="cl-7E13AE">Energy Efficient</b> Our neon lighted signs are
            both economical and
            ecologically friendly. They have low energy consumption and a 50,000+ hour lifespan. </p>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify mb-2">- <b class="cl-7E13AE">Safe </b> Our custom LED signs are made from
            neon LED light
            tubes that are kid-safe. There is no breakable glass, and the LED lights do not heat up so they are safe
            to touch.
        </p>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify mb-2">- <b class="cl-7E13AE">Easy to Install </b> All of our Custom Neon™
            lights come with
            pre-drilled holes for easy hanging & wall mounting.

        </p>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify mb-2">- <b class="cl-7E13AE">Low Maintenance </b> Our Custom Neon™ signs are
            very hardwearing and
            easy to clean.
        </p>
        <p class="cl-44444 text-justify mb-2">- <b class="cl-7E13AE"> Lightweight </b> Our custom designed signs are
            lightweight and
            portable, making them perfect as neon signs for weddings, unique signs for bedroom decor, and highly
            individual gift ideas.
