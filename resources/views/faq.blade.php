                        <p class="cl-44444">Hanging your new neon light sign is surprisingly easy. EpicCraftings signs
                            weigh 6-11lb on average and include pre-drilled holes on the acrylic backboard. On average,
                            most signs weigh approximately 6-11lb. EpicCraftings signs are safe to transport and easy to
                            install.</p>
                        <p class="cl-44444">For wall mounting your new neon light, you’ll need one of our Sign Hanging
                            or Wall Mounting kits. You can also do it yourself with hardware store items:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fishing wire (we recommend using heavy-duty wire and using a fisherman knot/s)</li>
                            <li>Rope (we recommend securely knotting)</li>
                            <li>Heavy-duty removable hooks (We recommend using several removable hooks to hold up to
                                6-11lb)</li>

                        </ul>

            responsibility for any costs
            incurred when installing and/or uninstalling your sign. If, in the
            unlikely event that your sign is experiencing a presumed fault, we will request photos and videos for
            diagnostic purposes and may require the sign to be sent back to us
            for replacement or repair. If you have chosen to have your sign installed and/or hard-wired, EpicCraftings
            takes no responsibility for any costs incurred due to uninstalling
            and/or reinstalling your sign. If your sign has been hardwired in by an electrician it is at our sole
            discretion to decide if the occurring fault is covered under our 12-month
            warranty.</p>
