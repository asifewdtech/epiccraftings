            <p class="cl-44444 text-justify">ONeonCraft offers returns and refunds for faulty products only.
                EpicCraftings will make every effort to resolve the issue and may fix, replace, refund, or partially
                refund the
                product. The final resolution for faulty products, including refunds for the cost of the product and/or
                shipping, is decided on a case by case basis depending on the source of
                the fault, and is at the sole discretion of EpicCraftings.
            </p>
            <h3 class="cl-7E13AE py-3">ONeonCraft Warranty
            </h3>
            <p class="cl-44444 text-justify">ONeonCraft indoor products include a 1 year warranty which covers
                electrical components when used appropriately. EpicCraftings outdoor products include a 3 month
                warranty which covers electricity components when used appropriately. Resolution for faulty signs will
                be dependent on the source of the fault and will be determined between

            <h3 class="cl-7E13AE py-3">Warranty Coverage for Hard Wired & Installed S igns
            </h3>
            <p class="cl-44444 text-justify">ONeonCraft bears no responsibility for any costs incurred when installing
                and/or uninstalling your sign. If, in the unlikely event that your sign is experiencing a presumed
                fault,
                we will request photos and videos for diagnostic purposes and may require the sign to be sent back to us
                for replacement or repair. If you have chosen to have your sign
                installed and/or hard wired, ONeonCraft takes no responsibility for any costs incurred due to
                uninstalling and/or re-installing your sign. If your sign has been hardwired in by an
                electrician it is at our sole discretion to decide if the occurring fault is covered under our 12 month
                warranty.
